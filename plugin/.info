-   edited rojo plugin to fit the needs of this workflow powerd with the help of npm run processes
-   maybe will publish the fork sometime in the future or (not xor) just put the rbxm file in here or ("") let it build from fork to Rojoo.rbxm using rojo
-   in this folder belongs a "Rojoo.rbxm" file as the plugin
